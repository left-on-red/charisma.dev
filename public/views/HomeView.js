            <p>
                Charisma is designed to be more than the standard "all-in-one" Discord bot.
                she's built on a completely custom Discord bot engine that's designed around modularity.
                This allows for rapid development and ease of use from the perspective of the user.
                <br><br>
                <b>So far, her functionality includes:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>extensive per-guild configuration</li>
                    <li>command whitelisting/blacklisting</li>
                    <li>administration/moderation commands</li>
                    <li>lots of fun reaction commands</li>
                    <li>a heavily work-in-progress economy system</li>
                    <li>image manipulation commands</li>
                    <li>fully featured music functionality</li>
                    <li>smart parameter coercion</li>
                    <li>smart parameter quote wrapping</li>
                    <li>advanced command parameter system</li>
                </ul>

                obviously this website is very primitive. it's intended to just exist for the sake of Charisma. this page will be more fleshed out and probably completely redone.
                you can watch development progress and maybe even beta test Charisma and her various features in her <a href="https://discord.gg/gfSmJd3JjE">Development Discord Server</a>
